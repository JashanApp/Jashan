# Jashan
&lt;Juh-shuhn> A playlist collaboration app that allows people who are in close proximity to curate a music playlist together on a host phone in real-time.


## The Social Music App
Make real-time playlists with your friends and discover new music with them!

## A New Experience
Everyone has a unique music taste. When you are by yourself, you tend to listen to songs that fit your specific music taste. But there's a whole world of music out there that you have never experienced! Discovering songs with friends is not only an incredibly fun way to bond with others, but it is also a refreshing change in perspective!

## Music For All
Whether your group is a few people on a road trip or hundreds at a party, Jashan makes sure that everyone has a great time.

### Integrated with Spotify
Search for Spotify songs within Jashan and add them to the host's playlist. Only the host needs Spotify Premium.

### Voting System
Upvote songs you want to see played next for the group and downvote those that you don't.

### Smart Suggestions
Add songs the entire group will enjoy rather than just a few people through our novel recommendation algorithm.

### Social Network
Find people at parties with similar music interests. Go to upcoming parties with them.

## Connect with Other Music Lovers
We give you similarity scores with others in your group so you can find those who share your music preferences. After adding friends to your account, you can plan Jashan parties in advance and invite friends to join you!
